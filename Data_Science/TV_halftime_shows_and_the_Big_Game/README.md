What is done in the Project?
I have loaded, cleaned, then explored Super Bowl game, television, and halftime show data. Visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. Used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. And discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.

In Detail:
-Answered the below questions
 *What are the most extreme game outcomes?
 *How does the game affect television viewership?
 *How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved?
 *Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

Taking note of dataset issues
           -The Super Bowl goes back to 1967, and the more granular columns (e.g. the number of songs for halftime musicians) probably weren't tracked reliably over time.

Combined points distribution
---Let's start by looking at combined points for each Super Bowl by visualizing the distribution. Let's also pinpoint the Super Bowls with the highest and lowest scores.

Point difference distribution
Do blowouts translate to lost viewers?
Viewership and the ad industry over time
Halftime shows weren't always this great
Who has the most halftime show appearances?
 Who performed the most songs in a halftime show?
