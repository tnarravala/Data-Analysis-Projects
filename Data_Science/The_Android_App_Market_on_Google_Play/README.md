Google Play Store apps and reviews

Mobile apps are everywhere. They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. In this project, I have done a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories.

Exploring app categories
Distribution of app ratings
Size and price of an app
How can we effectively come up with strategies to size and price our app?

Does the size of an app affect its rating?
Do users care about system-heavy apps or do they prefer light-weighted apps?
Does the price of an app affect its rating?
Do users always prefer free apps over paid apps?
The relation between app category and app price
Filter out "junk" apps
The popularity of paid apps vs free apps
Sentiment analysis of user reviews
      --------Mining user review data to determine how people feel about your product, brand, or service can be done using a technique called sentiment analysis. User reviews for apps can be analyzed to identify if the mood is positive, negative, or neutral about that app. For example, positive words in an app review might include words such as 'amazing', 'friendly', 'good', 'great', and 'love'. Negative words might be words like 'malware', 'hate', 'problem', 'refund', and 'incompetent'.

By plotting sentiment polarity scores of user reviews for paid and free apps, we observe that free apps receive a lot of harsh comments, as indicated by the outliers on the negative y-axis. Reviews for paid apps appear never to be extremely negative. This may indicate something about app quality, i.e., paid apps being of higher quality than free apps on average. The median polarity score for paid apps is a little higher than free apps, thereby syncing with our previous observation.
