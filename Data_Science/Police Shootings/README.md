# Police Shootings

In this project, I have done data visulizations and found pretty interesting insights.

From the data,It seems like that White american were shot by the police most often during police engagement.

Among unarmed people white people were killed the most followed by the black people

most of the people who were shot were between late twenties and early thirties
